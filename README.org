#+description: Personal dotfiles

* Overview

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This is my /minimal/ [[https://archlinux.org][Linux]] setup with [[https://www.xfce.org/][XFCE4]], [[https://qtile.org/][Qtile]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], and some custom stuff for efficiency.

** Qtile

** XFCE

** Philosophy
+ Keyboard-driven workflow with vim keybindings across all applications
+ Unix philosophy
+ Free ((or open-source)) software tools
+ Plain text configuration files that are transparent and version-controllable

** Directory Structure

** Features
*** 34 keys
34 keys feel extremely comfortable 😀.

*** Colemak DH for =BASE= + combos
Combos for most common symbols, =CAPS= and =DEL=

*** =CED= layer
+ When using US intl. layout, =RALT + ,= produces a =ç=
+ =CED= layer is then activated for the next keypress, with easy access to:
  - =õ= and =ã=
  - =ões= and =ão=

*** Typing with only 2 layers
Initially, I used separate layers for numbers and symbols, inspired by [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku][miryoku]].
I later found that holding the outer thumb keys on the Corne is a bit uncomfortable, but pressing keys with the right hand while holding a thumb key on the same hand actually feels fine.
I’m now experimenting with having just one additional layer for typing, accessed by holding the most comfortable right-hand thumb key (the one that’s less messed up).

*** =SYM= layer
+ Top row: numbers, mimicking a classic keyboard layout
+ Left hand: symbols
+ Right hand: =() [] {} <>=

*** Home row mods on =BASE= and =SYM=
+ hold homerow keys to activate mods
+ includes right alt

*** Sticky =MOU= layer
After holding the corresponding layer key and pressing any key defined in =MOU=, the layer remains active even after releasing the key.
The layer automatically turns off when a =KC_TRNS= or =KC_NO= key is pressed.
These layers are mostly used for navigation keys, which are often pressed in sequences. Keeping the layer sticky prevents strain from holding the layer key for extended periods — you only need to hold it for the first keypress.
